The data structure I used for this assignment is a Hash Table. The MyTrends.h file has a MyTrends class and an Entry class. The Entry class is what makes up the hash table array. MyTrends has four public functions: increaseCount(), getCount(), getNthPopular(), and numEntries(). MyTrends also has 7 private functions that assist the four public functions to perform standard hash table tasks.  

The increaseCount function just calls the private insert function. Insert() has a runtime bound of O(n) where n is the size of the table, granted that the table does not need to be resized. A resize occurs when the loadfactor is equal to or greater than 0.5. Resizing has a runtime bound of O(n^2) because it requires nested loops to resize the table. The getCount() function uses find() which has a runtime bound of O(n). The getNthPopular() method has a runtime bound of O(n^2) due to nested for loops. String2Key has a runtime bound of O(n) where n is based on the length of the string. Finally, numEntries(), hash(), hash2(), and loadFactor() methods are constant time because they don't use loops and just return values.
